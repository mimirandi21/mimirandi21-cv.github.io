        <h3>Problem Solving and Critical Thinking</h3>
        <p>Problem solving and critical thinking are two skills I take pride in my strength in.
          My previous job required me to use these skills on a daily basis, helping my team overcome issues and quickly resolve circumstances to give the best customer experience.
          As a leader in my role, I was often the go-to person with questions about every facet of the business, even the patient care roles.
          It was a point of pride for me to often know the information and be able to assist every member of my team, from the patient access representative to the providers and to know
          that they trusted me to be a source of assistance in every situation. I also knew how to best use my resources to find the answer if I was unsure or it was outside my
          scope of practice.

        <h3>Multi-tasking and Adaptability</h3>
        <p>I hear lots of arguements lately on whether it is possible to multi-task and let me say - it may be hard, but it is definetly possible!
            Multi-tasking was likely 80% of my day at my previous job. There was never just one thing going on. I had to be listening to everything going on at all times.
            Often, I would be talking on the phone to a patient and someone would ask me a question or ask me to do something when I was done.
            It was expected that I would respond or complete these tasks - and I would. Sometimes, this meant my desk was covered in post-it notes but I was able to prioritize
            the work asked of me and get it all done or ask for help when needed.
